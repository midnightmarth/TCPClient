# TCPClient
A TCP Client that communicates with Help.com Interview Challenge's TCP server.
The only component that is missing is the config.js file that stores the ip address and port. Just make a new script named **config.js**
and input the following...
```
module.exports.IpAddress = {
  IpAddress = 'Put Ip here'
}
module.exports.port = {
  port = 'Put port here'
}
```
